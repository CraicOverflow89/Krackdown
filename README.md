Krackdown Project
=================

Just a small Kotlin / ANTLR4 project to convert markdown to HTML.

### Tasks

 - convert all inline code into visitors (a class for each rule that has a method to be called recursively)
 - develop visual indentation for debug console output
 - finish building the header transformations
 - write rules for bold, italic and strikethrough (including alternatives)
 - write rules for links and images
 - write rules for code highlighting (single and multiple lines)
 - write rules for tables
 - write rules for blockquotes
 - write rules for inline HTML
 - write rules for horizontal rule and line breaks
 - write plenty of test cases for all rules

### Issues

 - headers are not working
 - formatting has been broken
