Krackdown Project
=================

Just a small Kotlin / ANTLR4 project to convert markdown to HTML.

### Tasks

 - finish building the header transformations
 - write rules for bold, italic and strikethrough
 - write rules for lists
 - write rules for links and images
 - write rules for code highlighting (single and multiple lines)
 - write rules for tables
 - write rules for blockquotes
 - write rules for inline HTML
 - write rules for horizontal rule and line breaks

### Issues

 - headers are not working
 - we are not handling double line breaks to <br> tags
