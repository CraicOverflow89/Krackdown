Krackdown Project
=================

Just a small Kotlin / ANTLR4 project to convert markdown to HTML.

### Tasks

 - develop visual indentation for debug console output
 - write rules for bold, italic and strikethrough alternatives
 - write rules for images
 - write rules for code highlighting (single and multiple lines)
 - write rules for tables
 - write rules for blockquotes
 - write rules for inline HTML
 - write rules for horizontal rule and line breaks
 - write plenty of test cases for all rules

### Issues

 - some headers are not being recognised (will be moving to single rule for 1-6 hashes anyway)
 - formatting has been broken since updating link stuff (links need checking, too)
